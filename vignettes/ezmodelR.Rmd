## Overview

The `ezmodelR` package provides a collection of functions that make it easier to extract information from various models for the purpose of comparing them. The package is meant to be used in conjunction with the `caret` package and offers new scoring methods, the ability to view the results of regularization, and the ability to quickly and easily compare training and test error of a model while varying a parameter.

### Plotting Regularization Results

The `regularization_plot` function allows the user to view a plot comparing coefficient magnitude and regularization strength for:

- L2-regularized regression (specified by `model='ridge'`)
- L1-regularized regression (specified by `model='lasso'`)
- L2-regularized logistic regression with a binary outcome (specified by `model='logistic'`)

The function takes arguments specifying the type of model, the regularization strength `lambda` (which can be a vector of different values), a **dataframe** `x` for the features, and a **dataframe** `y` for the response. An optional tolerance argument `tol` can be specified.

There are two main types of plots that can be created. If `lambda` is a vector of length 1, then the plot will display the magnitude of the coefficients of the model. 

```
regularization_plot('lasso', lambda=2, x=X, y=Y)
```


If `lambda` has a length larger than 1, then the plot will display the number of nonzero coefficients of the models produces vs. the regularization strength.

```
regularization_plot('ridge', 'lambda=2^c(-1,0,1), x=X, y=y)
```

The optional tolerance argument can be useful if you want to treat all coefficients with a magnitude smaller than some number as 0. By default, `tol=1e-7`, so any coefficient with a magnitude less than that will be treated as 0 for plotting purposed.

The function will return a `ggplot2` plot of the object, which is convenient as the data plotted (e.g. coefficient values) can then be extracted from it.
